src --> there are two folders :  --> FPU where it is present the FPU provided as the material for this lab and the behavioural description of the multiplier 	 								 inside fpnew_fma.sv is substitued with the instantioation of the mantissa multiplier implemented.

								--> mantissa_multiplier where there are the modules implemented for the mantissa multiplier requested
									

sim --> there are the following folders : --> txt_files where you can find the files: results.txt the one containing the theoretical results of the 												multiplication, results_hdl_dadda_rtl.txt and results_hdl_dadda_net.txt containing respectively the results 												produced by the simulation of the rtl description and the netlist description
												
										--> sim_mult containing the script sim.do necessary for the simulation of the mantissa multiplier as a standalone
												
										--> sim_tot containing the script sim_tot.do necessary for the simulation of the FPU with the mantissa multiplier 												implemented 

										--> sim_net containing the script sim_net.do necessary for the simulation of the netlist generated by synopsys

syn --> there are the following folders : --> area_report where it is present the output of the command report_area
												
										--> timing_report where it is present the output of the command report_timing
												
										-->synth.syn is the script used for the synthesis requested


tb --> there are the following folders : --> tb_net where there are the testbench files necessary for simulating the netlist synthesized from synopsys at the
											 max_freq
 
										--> tb_tot where there are the testbench files necessary for simulating the rtl description of the FPU with mantissa 												multiplier implemented 

										--> multiplier_tb.sv is the testbench file used for simulating the mantissa multiplier as a standalone element

netlist --> there are the netlist file "fpnew_top.v" and th sdf file "fpnew_top.sdf" generated by synopsys after the synthesis
